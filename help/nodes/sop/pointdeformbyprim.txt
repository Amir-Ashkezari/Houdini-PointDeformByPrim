= Point Deform By Prim =

""" Point deformation based on capturing primtive position of another geometry stream provides more accurate lookup position. """

This node deform(P) and interpolate(N, v, etc) the existing point attributes in the geometry based on another geometry stream.

== Using Point Deform By Prim ==

# Select the geometry node.

# Put down an Point Deform By Prim node.

# Connect second input to the rest geometry and third input to the deforming geometry, the rest/deforming geometry must be the same.
